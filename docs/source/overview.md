# Overview

The purpose of the `ivadomed` project is to provide researchers
with an open-source framework for training deep learning models for
applications in medical imaging.

## Features

### Physic-informed network
CNNs can be modulated, at each layer, using the [Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07871.pdf)) technique. FiLM permits to add priors during training/inference
based on the imaging physics (e.g. acquisition parameters), thereby improving the
performance of the output segmentations.

### Two-step training with class sampling
Class sampling, coupled with a transfer learning strategy, can mitigate class
imbalance issues, while addressing the limitations of classical under-sampling
(risk of loss of information) or over-sampling (risk of overfitting) approaches.

During a first training step, the CNN is trained on an equivalent proportion of
positive and negative samples, negative samples being under-weighted dynamically
at each epoch. During the second step, the CNN is fine-tuned on the realistic
(i.e. class-imbalanced) dataset.

### Mixup
[Mixup](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09412.pdf) is a data augmentation technique,
wherein training is performed on samples that are generated by combining two
random samples from the training set and from the associated labels. The motivation
is to regularize the network while extending the training distribution.

### Data augmentation on lesion ground-truths
This data augmentation is motivated by the large inter-rater variability that is
typical in medical image segmentation tasks. Typically, raters disagree on the boundaries
of pathologies (e.g., tumors, lesions). A soft mask is constructed by morphological
dilation of the binary segmentation (i.e. mask provided by expert), where
expert-labeled voxels have one as value while the augmented voxels are assigned
a soft value which depends on the distance to the core of the lesion. Thus,
the prior knowledge about the subjective lesion borders is then leveraged to the network.
