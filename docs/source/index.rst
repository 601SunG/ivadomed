learning. The name is a portmanteau between *IVADO* (The `Institute for data
valorization <https://ivado.ca/en/>`_) and *Medical*.

- Provide researchers with an open-source framework for training deep learning models for applications in medical imaging;

- Provide ready-to-use :doc:`models` trained on multi-center data.
